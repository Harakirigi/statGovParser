# StatParser - Easy Stat Parsing for Data Science Projects

StatParser is a user-friendly tool designed to parse statistics from the [stat.gov.kz](https://stat.gov.kz/) website for data science projects. With its intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), users can easily select the statistics they need, download them in various formats (Excel, CSV, JSON), and have them ready for analysis in seconds.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: An intuitive GUI that allows users to select their desired statistics by category, subcategory, and file type without needing to deal with complex commands or code.
- **Flexible File Formats**: Download the parsed statistics in the format that suits your needs — Excel, CSV, or JSON.
- **Category-Based Parsing**: Choose from a variety of categories such as Economics, Population, Prices, and more. You can narrow down your selection to specific subfields and files.
- **Quick and Efficient Parsing**: Select the statistics you need, and the tool will download them in a flash, saving you time and effort.
- **Executable File (.exe)**: A stand-alone executable file to easily run the application on Windows without needing additional setup.

## How It Works

1. **Select Categories**: Choose the desired field of statistics (e.g., Economics, Population, Prices).
2. **Choose Subcategories**: Select the subfields that interest you (e.g., Price Statistics, Employment Statistics).
3. **Select File Format**: Choose your preferred file format (Excel, CSV, or JSON).
4. **Download**: Click on the download button, and the StatParser will retrieve the selected statistics for you.
